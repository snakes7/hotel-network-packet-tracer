- Always configure clock rates at the DCE 

- The clock rate of a DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment) device determines the speed at which data is transmitted across a WAN link. 
	It's usually expressed in bits per second (bps) or kilobits per second (Kbps), 
	megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps) for WAN links.
